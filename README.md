## 🧠 Research Focus
Our research addresses key challenges in clinical imaging and intelligent healthcare systems:

* **Medical Image Synthesis:** Generating synthetic data, handling missing modalities, and image super-resolution to enhance quality.
* **Clinical Analysis:** Automated disease diagnosis and precise medical image segmentation.
* **Federated Learning:** Learning from distributed and heterogeneous data sources to preserve privacy while improving model robustness.
* **Efficiency:** Developing annotation-efficient models to reduce the burden of manual labeling.
